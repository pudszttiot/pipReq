Dependencies
------------------
The application relies on the following dependencies:


Usage
--------

"run pipreqs"

The "pipreqs" command serves a specific purpose in the Python programming language. Its main job is to analyze your Python code and automatically generate a list of the external libraries or packages that your code depends on. In simpler terms, it helps you figure out what additional tools or modules you need to install in order for your Python program to work correctly.

Let's say you've written a Python script that uses certain functions or features from other existing libraries, such as NumPy or requests. When you run the "pipreqs" command on your code, it scans through your script and detects the specific libraries that your code relies on. It then generates a list, known as requirements.txt, which contains the names of these libraries and their respective versions.

This list of requirements.txt can be incredibly useful, especially when you want to share your code with others or deploy it on different systems. By sharing this file, other developers or users can easily install the necessary libraries with a single command, using the pip package manager, which is the standard tool for installing Python packages.

To summarize, the purpose of the "pipreqs" command is to automate the process of identifying and listing the external libraries required by your Python code, making it easier for others to set up and run your program without worrying about missing dependencies.


"run pip check"

The purpose of the "run pip check" command is to help you identify and fix any issues or errors in your Python packages.

When you install Python packages using the "pip" command, sometimes there can be problems with the installation. These problems could include missing dependencies, incompatible versions, or other issues that may cause your code to not work correctly.

By running the "pip check" command, you're asking Python to check the installed packages and verify if there are any problems. It will examine the packages and their dependencies to see if everything is in order. If any issues are found, it will provide you with information about what went wrong and suggest possible solutions.

In simple terms, running "pip check" is like asking Python to double-check all the packages you've installed, making sure they're working properly and compatible with each other. It helps you catch and resolve any problems that could cause your Python code to not run as expected.


"run pur"

The 'pur -r requirements.txt' command is used to clean up and update the Python packages installed in a project based on the requirements.txt file. In simple terms, it helps ensure that only the necessary and correct versions of the packages are installed.

Here's a breakdown of what the command does:

'pur' is short for 'purge,' which means to remove or eliminate something.
'-r' specifies that we are providing a requirements file as input.
'requirements.txt' is the file that contains a list of all the required Python packages and their versions for a project.
When you run the 'pur -r requirements.txt' command, it analyzes the current environment and compares it with the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. It then removes any unnecessary packages that are not listed and updates the existing ones to match the specified versions.

This command is especially useful when working with Python projects that have many dependencies because it helps maintain a clean and consistent set of packages, ensuring that the project runs smoothly and as intended.


"run pip freeze"

The command "pip freeze > requirements.txt" is used to create a file called "requirements.txt" that lists all the software libraries and their specific versions that are installed in a Python project.

Here's a simple breakdown of its purpose:

pip: Pip is a package management system used in Python to install and manage software packages or libraries.

freeze: The "freeze" command is a parameter of pip. When used with pip, it generates a list of all the installed packages and their versions.

>: The ">" symbol is a redirect operator in the command line. It tells the system to take the output of the previous command and save it to a file.

requirements.txt: "requirements.txt" is the name of the file where the output of the "pip freeze" command will be saved. This file is commonly used to specify the dependencies of a Python project.

So, by running "pip freeze > requirements.txt," you're essentially capturing a snapshot of the installed packages and versions in your project and saving it to a file. This file can then be shared with others, allowing them to replicate the exact package environment of your project by running "pip install -r requirements.txt." It ensures that everyone working on the project has the same dependencies, which helps maintain consistency and avoids compatibility issues.


"Install modules from requirements.txt"

The purpose of the "pip install -r requirements.txt" command is to install all the necessary software libraries or packages that a project or program needs to run correctly.

When you develop software, you often rely on existing libraries or modules that provide pre-written code for specific functionalities. These libraries are usually created by other developers and are made available for anyone to use.

The "pip install" part of the command is a tool called pip, which stands for "package installer for Python." It's used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of software libraries for the Python programming language.

The "-r requirements.txt" part tells pip to read a file named "requirements.txt" to determine which packages need to be installed. This file typically lists all the dependencies required by the project, along with their specific versions.

So, when you run "pip install -r requirements.txt," pip reads the requirements file and automatically installs all the necessary packages, ensuring that your project has all the required components to function correctly.



Uninstallation
